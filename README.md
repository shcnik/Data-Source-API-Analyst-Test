# Data-Source-API-Analyst-Test

In this repository we check GitHub API endpoints for these tasks set by client:

- **Search repositories**: we load repository info by name or get all repositories of a user (possibly filtered)
- **Commits**: we load list of commits for a repository with info on every commit
- **Contents**: we load info on contents of a directory inside repository.
